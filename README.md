#  Programming & AI Learning Portfolio

Hi! I’m Trisha (she/her), a Computer Science student at Leeds Beckett University. This repository is where I collect and organize everything I’ve been learning — from Python basics to AI concepts. It’s a mix of code, notes, experiments, and reflections as I grow my skills week by week.

##  What’s in This Repo?

This repo includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
  Step-by-step lessons and exercises on programming fundamentals, file handling, functions, data structures, and more.

- **Logbook**  
  Weekly Markdown notes where I reflect on what I’ve learned, what confused me, and what clicked. Topics include debugging, error handling, AI integration, and coding principles like DRY and WET.

- **Project Files**  
  Python scripts, chatbot experiments, and other mini-projects that helped me apply what I’ve learned.

- **AI Declaration**  
  A transparent explanation of how I’ve used AI tools to support my learning — responsibly and honestly.

## 🚀 Why I Made This

I wanted a space to:

- Track my progress and see how far I’ve come  
- Keep my notes organized and easy to review  
- Share my learning journey with others  
- Build a foundation for future projects in Python, Machine Learning, and AI
